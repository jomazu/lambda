## Haskell

Is a **FUNCTIONAL** programming language, treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding state and mutable data.

In contrast, with **IMPERATIVE** programs, you can execute statement by statement, keeping track of the values of variables (the stack) and where you are in the program (the program counter).
  * There are only expressions in Haskell, i.e. no statements.
* Things that look like assignments in Haskell are not updates of values but equations.
